**Brief Introduction** In short, our project is an attempt to enlight and teach audiences about the rate of Deforestation, in particularly over our lifetime to show what we have lived through perhaps without even realising. It provides reliable information and statistics that are memorable and clear, collectively becoming a call to action to envoke the need for change to current lifestyles.

**Dataset** The dataset we have used (as explained within the visualistion itself to be transparent to our audience) was collected from the World Resource Institute's Global Forest Watch (GFR). The dataset is accredited for its detailed analysis and updated frequently, therefore the best choice for our project. In our project, we used the 'tree cover loss' dataset to find the sum of tree cover loss from 2001-2022, and distinguish the countries with the highest rates of deforestation.
