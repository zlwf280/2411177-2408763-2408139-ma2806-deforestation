      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In an era tainted by drastic, dire changes in our environment, our project’s aim is to shed light on this fluctuation, but through the lens of the unrelenting pace of deforestation that is changing our landscapes. Our research question is: How has the extent and nature of deforestation evolved over the last century, and will there be trends to help understand our future? 
        <br><br>
        We are highlighting our blurred understanding of deforestation and its vast impact, attempting to elaborate on its importance through a mixture of engaging visualisation and written theoretical text. Through an in-depth graphical analysis of deforestation trends during the last century, we want to decipher the intricate story of environmental degradation and its global ramifications. 
        <br><br>
        This project is not just an effort for the sake of academics, but rather is an investigation of a 
        misunderstood phenomena by those passionate about stopping its cause, and a call to action that invites audiences to reevaluate our individual and collective environmental policy and motivate activities that support a more ecologically aware and sustainable global community.

      <h2>Data Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        The Global Forest Review (GFR) is an impartial evaluation of the state of the world's forests since 2001 that uses extensive geospatial data and analysis and is the main source of data used in this project. To ensure a high degree of accuracy, their analysis makes use of hundreds of different datasets in addition to sophisticated satellite images. However, limitations in forecasting models, difficulties characterising deforestation, and differences in methodology could lead to possible disparities. In spite of this, the project's study on deforestation trends has a solid base due to the WRI's comprehensive validation process.

      <h2>'Tree Cover Loss'</h2>
      <p>
        The term "tree cover loss" describes the removal or reduction of trees in a given area, frequently as a result of human activity like logging, increased agricultural production, or infrastructure development. Natural disasters like wildfires and disease outbreaks might also be the cause of it. When the amount of forest cover is lost at a rate that drastically lowers the total amount of forested area, it is considered deforestation and causes habitat damage, biodiversity loss, soil erosion, and higher carbon emissions. Therefore, one of the most important metrics for tracking and evaluating the degree of deforestation and its effects on the environment is the loss of tree cover.
      </p>

      <h2>Top 9 Countries With the Highest Total Sum of Tree Forest Loss, 2001-2021 (million hectares)</h2>
      <p>
        Russia - 80.3 million hectares<br>
        Brazil - 66.1 million hectares<br>
        Canada - 48.9 million hectares<br>
        United States - 46.5 million hectares<br>
        Indonesia - 29.4 million hectares<br>
        Congo - 18.4 million hectares<br>
        China - 11.5 million hectares<br>
        Malaysia - 8.9 million hectares<br>
        Australia - 8.8 million hectares<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        Did you expect Russia to be at the top of the list?<br><br>
        The startling discovery that Russia has greater rates of deforestation than Brazil contradicts widely held beliefs. Russia's boreal forests and other important biomes have been overlooked by the exclusive focus on the Amazon Rainforest, frequently at the forefront of talks over deforestation. Despite being essential carbon sinks and biodiversity repositories, these Siberian forests get little attention. This surprising rating emphasises how important it is to increase our knowledge and consciousness of deforestation. 
        Here is some more vital information surrounding each of these countries:

      <h3>Russia</h3>
      <p>
        With over 45% of its land area covered in natural forest, the shock of Russia being the leading country in deforestation rates is further multiplied with the counteractive percentage of ‘loss likely to be permanent’: 0%. This surprisingly points to a chance for recovery and sustainability in Russian forestry methods and indicates a great potential for natural or assisted regeneration. Regardless, this loss is primarily in Siberia, linked to logging (illegal or not), wildfires and more.
